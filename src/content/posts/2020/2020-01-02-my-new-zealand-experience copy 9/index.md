In 2015 I found out about this New Zealand working holiday visa which allows one to live and work in New Zealand for a year or two depending where you are from. Up to that point I didn't know much about New Zealand but I was truly fascinated by it when I attended an event where a girl shared her experiences from living in New Zealand for a year. The photos she showed were amazing and I was quite shocked I had not seen much photos of New Zealand before. That settled and plans to go to New Zealand were in the works.

I arrived in New Zealand beginning of 2017 in Auckland after solo backpacking Vietnam for couple of amazing weeks so I felt comfortable being alone so far away from home and was excited about what's ahead. I arrived in Auckland Airport and realized I have yet to book an accommodation so did just that before heading out - Base Hostel - cheapest hostel downtown Auckland I could find (No affiliation). Arriving in downtown Auckland I was so stoked, this city was huge, it was exciting, start of a new chapter in life. I had my fair share of travel around Europe and I had seen some big cities but this felt different somehow. The hostel was kind of meh and everything was ridiculously expensive so I had to lower my having good time expectations a little bit for a while and start looking for a job of some sorts.

Up to this point, my idea was to stay for 6 months in Auckland, 3 in Wellington and 3 in Queenstown while doing all the travel before leaving the country. Also I was overwhelmed with travel possibilities in New Zealand, there were a couple of bus companies doing the entire country with stops in all major tourist locations like Kiwi Experience and Stray. Lot of backpackers were buying a van and doing their travels that way. Also there were a lot of van rental companies like Jucy. I had no idea which route I wanted to take. I will probably write a separate post about practical tips and advice on backpacking New Zealand some time later, stay tuned for that.
